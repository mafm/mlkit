SIGDOC

This directory contains a tool for generating HTML documentation for
Standard ML signatures.

The tool takes as arguments a set of signature files, containing single
signatures, and a set of implementation files.

The tool scans the signature files to obtain the set of signature
identifiers. For each signature identifier, the tool generates a
documentation page with documentation for each specified
identifier. Also, the tool scans the implementation files for
structure identifiers, identifying implementations of the signatures
and generates a documentation page with an index over structure
identifier (with links to the signature documentation).

Signature files must conform to the following structure:

---------------
(** general comment ... *)

signature A = sig
  type a
  ...
  val b : a -> unit
end

(**
  [a] is a type.

  [b a] returns unit.
*)
