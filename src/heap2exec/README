This directory contains a simple machanism for building stand-alone
smlnj executables.  It wraps, in the following order, two binary
files into one: an smlnj runtime, and a smlnj heap.  
Note that the runtime must be slightly modified to detect and 
extract a piggy-backed heap.

Do a 'make' in this directory to produce 'heap2exec'.

Invoke 'heap2exec' as:

	heap2exec the-runtime the-heap the-executable

'the-runtime' is the smlnj runtime to put into the stand-alone executable; 
'the-heap' is the smlnj heap to put in the stand-alone 'the-executable'.


Note: a runtime system compatible with this tool must be built by
compiling it with the symbol HACKED_STANDALONE defined; that is,
invoke 'make' as:

	make -f mk.x86-linux "XDEFS=-DHACKED_STANDALONE"

in the src/runtime/objs directory.  

If the desired mk.<arch>-<os> file does not contain an XDEF entry,
add an empty one following e.g. mk.x86-linux
