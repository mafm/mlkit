           **** SMLserver version 3.9.1 is released ****

 * mael 2001-07-12: Space bug fixed. Each time a request was 
   served, a new stack was allocated but never freed; the
   implementation now recycles allocated stacks.

   Ns.mail) added to Ns structure.

   information about server setup added to Ns structure.

   status. Bug reported by Johnny Andersen.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Quotation support. The datatype 
      datatype 'a frag = QUOTE of string | ANTIQUOTE of 'a
   is available in the top-level environment. Moreover, the character
   ` cease to be allowed in symbolic identifiers. Values of the 'a
   frag datatype may be constructed using the quotation/antiquotation
   syntax:
        val s = "world" 
        val a : string frag list = `hello ^s - goodbye`
   Quotation support makes for a nice way of embedding HTML and SQL 
   in your web-applications.

   return -1 to the shell (instead of 0). Suggestion by Stephen Weeks.

   returns a file name for a file in /tmp/ (instead of in /etc/). Bug
   reported by Stephen Weeks.

 * mael & nh: bytecode backend added as an alternative to the x86
   native backend; primarily, the bytecode backend is added for 
   portability and for use with the SMLserver project, which adds 
   Standard ML language support to AOLserver -- a webserver from 
   America Online.
