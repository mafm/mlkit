File NEWS_SMLSERVER

 * mael 2002-03-19: Added possibility for caching loaded leaf-bytecode
   files (flag CODE_CACHE in LoadKAM.h). This feature improves on the
   number of requests that can be served per second. Default: enabled.

           **** SMLserver version 4.1.0 is released ****

 * mael 2002-01-29: Cleaned up documentation and demonstration
   examples.

 * nh 2001-12-29: Added support for MySQL

 * mael 2001-10-09: Added support for threaded simultaneous responses
   of requests. Serving a request is no longer blocked by the serving
   of other requests.

 * nh 2001-10-05: Added multilingual support in ScsFormVar module. 

 * mael 2001-09-30: Changed the name of the SMLserver compiler from
   mlkit_web to smlserverc.

 * nh 2001-09-23: Added dictionary support for multilingual language
   support. Additional modules ScsDict, ScsLogin, and ScsLang.

 * nh 2001-09-21: Added support for checking form variables
   (module /scs/ScsFormVar.sml). Added two utility packages: 
   /scs/ScsDate and /scs/ScsList. Fixed authentication example. It 
   now works on both PostgreSQL and Oracle.

 * nh 2001-09-17: Added support for cookies, caching. Added
   authentication example with simple filtering.

 * mael 2001-07-22: Primitives for accessing the AOLserver
   configuration file added to the Ns structure. Also added primitive 
   for getting the url associated with a request.

           **** SMLserver version 3.9.2 is released ****

 * mael 2001-07-19: Proper handling of uncaught exceptions. To avoid
   that AOLserver is killed when an SMLserver web-page evaluates to an
   uncaught exception, the interpreter no longer uses the exit system
   call to terminate execution when an uncaught exception appears. 
   Instead, the interpreter returns a status code of -1 (or -2 if the
   uncaught exception is Interrupt). In case the interpreter returns
   -1, a warning is written to the server log. The Interrupt exception
   can thus be used to terminate an SMLserver web-page without
   generating a warning.

 * mael 2001-07-19: Added Interrupt exception to front end.

           **** SMLserver version 3.9.1 is released ****

 * mael 2001-07-12: Space bug fixed. Each time a request was 
   served, a new stack was allocated but never freed; the
   implementation now recycles allocated stacks.

 * mael 2001-07-12: Functionality for sending email (Ns.sendmail/
   Ns.mail) added to Ns structure.

 * mael 2001-07-12: Support for accessing request headers and 
   information about server setup added to Ns structure.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Bug fix: valrec may now overwrite identifier
   status. Bug reported by Johnny Andersen.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Quotation support. The datatype 
      datatype 'a frag = QUOTE of string | ANTIQUOTE of 'a
   is available in the top-level environment. Moreover, the character
   ` cease to be allowed in symbolic identifiers. Values of the 'a
   frag datatype may be constructed using the quotation/antiquotation
   syntax:
        val s = "world" 
        val a : string frag list = `hello ^s - goodbye`
   Quotation support makes for a nice way of embedding HTML and SQL 
   in your web-applications.

 * mael 2001-07-05: An uncaught exception now causes the program to
   return -1 to the shell (instead of 0). Suggestion by Stephen Weeks.

 * mael 2001-07-05: Bug fix: The function OS.FileSys.tmpName now
   returns a file name for a file in /tmp/ (instead of in /etc/). Bug
   reported by Stephen Weeks.

 * mael & nh: bytecode backend added as an alternative to the x86
   native backend; primarily, the bytecode backend is added for 
   portability and for use with the SMLserver project, which adds 
   Standard ML language support to AOLserver -- a webserver from 
   America Online.
