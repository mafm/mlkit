* mael 2008-08-13: Added support for accessing compiled SML functions
  from JavaScript programs. At the SML side, values are exported using
  the _export keyword. Here is an example:

   fun myfun x = x + 1
   val () = _export("myfun", myfun)

  Expressions of the form _export("myfun", v) has type unit. The first
  argument to _export must be an immediate string and the second
  argument must be a value of type t -> t, where each of the t's must
  be of the form

   t  ::= int | word | word31 | int31 | real | string | bool
        | word8 | char | t * ... * t

  After the _export construct has been executed, the exported function
  can be called from JavaScript, as follows:

   var a = SMLtoJs.myfun(4);
