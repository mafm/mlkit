SMLtoJs NEWS file

* mael 2007-10-23: Datatype Constructors are now represented as
  numbers and there is support now for unboxing simple datatypes such
  as lists.

* mael 2007-08-16: SMLtoJs version 4.3.5 is released.

* mael 2008-08-13: Added support for accessing compiled SML functions
  from JavaScript programs. At the SML side, values are exported using
  the _export keyword. Here is an example:

   fun myfun x = x + 1
   val () = _export("myfun", myfun)

  Expressions of the form _export("myfun", v) has type unit. The first
  argument to _export must be an immediate string and the second
  argument must be a value of type t1 -> t2, where t1 and t2 are
  arbitrary types. There are no dynamic checks that values passed to
  exported functions are compatible with type t1; the responsibility
  for this is entirely the programmer's.

  After the _export construct has been executed, the exported function
  can be called from JavaScript, as follows:

   var a = SMLtoJs.myfun(4);

* mael 2008-01-14: Added support for linking with external libraries;
  use 'smltojs --help' to get information about the --jslibs command
  line option.
