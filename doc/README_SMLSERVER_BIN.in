                The SMLserver binary distribution
	              smlserver-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-i386

This readme file describes the structure of the SMLserver binary
distribution as well as necessary steps for proper personal and system
wide installation.

An overview of the directory structure of the distribution
is given in Appendix A.

1. System-wide Installation
---------------------------

Provided you have downloaded the binary distribution to the /tmp
directory, execute the following commands in a bash-shell - as root:
 
 % cd /tmp
 % tar xzvf smlserver-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-i386.tgz
 % cd smlserver-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-i386
 % cp -pa bin/* /usr/bin/
 % cp -pa lib/smlserver /usr/lib/smlserver
 % cp -pa share/man/man1/* /usr/share/man/man1/
 % cp -pa share/smlserver /usr/share/smlserver
 % cp -pa share/doc/smlserver /usr/share/doc/smlserver
 % mkdir /etc/smlserver
 % echo "SML_LIB /usr/lib/smlserver" > /etc/smlserver/mlb-path-map

All locations, except the system wide path-map /etc/smlserver/mlb-path-map
can be changed at will.

Any user on the system should now be able to run the commands
smlserverc, smlserver-wrap, and mspcomp.

2. Personal Installation
------------------------
Provided you have downloaded the binary distribution to your home
directory $HOME, execute the following commands:
 
 $ cd $HOME
 $ tar xzvf smlserver-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-i386.tgz
 $ ln -s smlserver-@PACKAGE_VERSION@-i386 smlserver
 $ mkdir .smlserver
 $ echo "SML_LIB $HOME/smlserver/lib/mlkit" > .smlserver/mlb-path-map

You can now either run the smlserverc command directly by specifying the
complete path or you can modify your personal PATH environment
variable to include $HOME/smlserver/bin.

Now, that SMLserver is installed, proceed with Chapter 2 of the book
"SMLserver - A Functional Approach to Web Publishing", available from
the SMLserver home page www.smlserver.org.
