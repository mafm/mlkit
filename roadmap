Directory structure
-------------------

  bin/		executable versions of the Kit and other programs
  src/		sources for the Kit and some utilities
  doc/		documentation. The User's Guide is called
                "Programming with Regions in the ML Kit" and is
                in doc/manuals/manual.ps . It is a PostScript file.
  test/  	test of the kit
  kitdemo/      example input for the kit (i.e., sml source files
                and project files)
  basislib/     Standard ML Basis Library for the Kit
  kitlib/       kit-specific library functions
  ml-yacc-lib/  interface to ML Yacc generated parsers

bin/ in detail
--------------

If you have built and installed the Kit (as described in file
"readme") this directory will contain an executable file "kit" (i.e.,
a script for launching SML/NJ with a kit-image.)

Two other tools are placed in the bin/ directory when the Kit is
built. These are the profiling graph tool `rp2ps' (Region Profile to
PostScript) and the Kit Tester Tool `kittester'. See below for
information about these tools.


src/ in detail
--------------

  src/sources.cm	list of source files for the kit
      Common/           source files
      Edlib/            the Kit still uses a couple of modules that
                        stem from the Edinburgh Library. These modules
                        are in the Edlib directory.
      Manager/          Modules concerning separate compilation and 
                        static interpretation.
      Parsing/          
      Compiler/ ...
               Hppa/	files specific to HP PA-RISC kit
	       C/	files specific to ANSI C kit
		...
      Runtime/		C source files and executables for runtime system.
      Tools/            sources for Kit tools (rp2ps and kittester)


src/Runtime/ in detail
----------------------

  src/Runtime/Runtime.c
                            ...
                        Makefile
                        runtime_hpux.o
                        runtime_prof_hpux.o
                        runtime_sun_os4.o
                        runtime_prof_sun_os4.o

See the file `Makefile'.


src/Tools/Rp2Ps/ in detail
--------------------------

  src/Tools/Rp2Ps/Rp2ps.c
                                 ...
                              Makefile
                              rp2psHPUX*
                              rp2psSUN_OS4* 

The tool `rp2ps' converts output from a program compiled with region
profiling enabled to a profile graph in postscript, that is, it
converts an .rp file to a .ps file.  See the file "Makefile".


src/Tools/Tester/ in detail
---------------------------

This directory holds the sources for the Kit Tester Tool.


test/ in detail
---------------

This directory holds test programs for the Kit. A regression test of
the Kit is made by invoking the Kit Tester Tool with a so called test
file as argument, which mentions what SML sources should be compiled
and run; the Kit Tester Tool tests if the output generated by the
compiler and the executable equals the output from a previous run. The
test measures how long it takes the kit (and different phases of it)
to compile the test programs. It also measures the run-time and memory
consumption of the code generated for the test programs. The tool
generates a dvi file, which can be viewed using the command `xdvi
test_report.dvi' from the test/ directory (provided you have the xdvi
program installed on your system). See the file "test/README" for
further details.


File types
----------

.sml		sml source files.
.c		C code generated by the ANSI C version of the kit
.s		HP PA-RISC code generated by the HP PA-RISC version of the kit
.o		.c or .s files compiled using gcc
.script		a `kit script' file sets references used globally in the kit
.log		"file.log" is a log from the compilation of "file.sml".
.vcg		a region flow graph in a text representation
		you need a particular program to view it.  See the file "readme".
.rp		output from program compiled with region profiling turned on. 
		run it through "rp2ps" to get a postscript file.
.tst            test files used by the Kit Tester Tool.
