Directory structure
-------------------

  bin/		executable kits, compiled programs, and related things
  src/		sources for the kit and some utilities
  doc/		documentation
  TestEnv/	for testing the kit
  kitdemo/      example input for the kit (i.e., sml source files
                and project files)
  basislib/     basis library (still incomplete)
  readme	read it
  roadmap	this file
  copyright	copyright notices


bin/ in detail
--------------

If you have built and installed the Kit (as described in file
"readme") this directory will contain an executable file "kit" (i.e.,
a script for launching SML/NJ with a kit-image.)

When the file "kit" is the executed, it will try to read in a kit
script file "kit.script" in the current directory. Entries that are
not present in the script file will have a default value.

Most of the settings that you can set in a kit script file can also be
set interactively.


src/ in detail
--------------

  src/sources.cm	list of source files for the kit
      Common/           source files
      Manager/
      Parsing/
      Compiler/ ...
               Hppa/	files specific to HP PA-RISC kit
	       C/	files specific to ANSI C kit
		...
      Runtime/		C source files and executables for runtime system


src/Runtime/Version17/ in detail
--------------------------------

  src/Runtime/Version17/Runtime.c
                            ...
                        Makefile
                        runtime_hpux.o
                        runtime_prof_hpux.o
                        runtime_sun_os4.o
                        runtime_prof_sun_os4.o
                        Rp2Ps/ ...

See the file "Makefile".


src/Runtime/Version17/Rp2Ps/ in detail
--------------------------------------

  src/Runtime/Version17/Rp2Ps/Rp2ps.c
                                 ...
                              Makefile
                              rp2psHPUX*
                              rp2psSUN_OS4* 

The tool "rp2ps" converts output from a program compiled with region
profiling enabled to a profile graph in postscript, that is, it
converts an .rp file to a .ps file.  See the file "Makefile".


TestEnv/ in detail
------------------

The ``test environment'' will make ``acceptance'' and
``performance'' tests.  If you do not intend to change the kit
source, you do not need the acceptance test: It tests whether a
given set of sml ``test programs'' compiled with the kit
generate the same output when run as they did with an earlier
version of the kit.  
   The performance test measures how long it takes the kit (and
different phases of it) to compile the test programs.  It also
measures the run-time and memory consumption of the code
generated for the test programs.

  TestEnv/ML_to_C_on_HPUX/AcceptanceTest/ ... 
                          PerformanceTest/ ...
                          test_reportML_to_C_on_HPUX.tex
                          test_reportML_to_C_on_HPUX.dvi
          ML_to_HPPA_on_HPUX/  ...
          ML_to_C_on_SUN_OS4/  ...
          Sources/
	  KitScripts/no_prof.script	kit scripts used for tests
		     prof.script
	  bin/memtime_hpux*		executables used for performance test
              memtime_sun_os4*
          Output_C_on_HPUX/
          Output_C_on_SUN_OS4/
          Output_HPPA_on_HPUX/


The directories of the form "ML_to_X_on_Y/..." contain the
result of the tests.  The test environment generates a test
report in file "test_reportML_to_C_on_HPUX.tex" which it tex's,
resulting in file "test_reportML_to_C_on_HPUX.dvi".  It does not
automatically call xdvi to show that file.

Directory "Sources/" contains sml test programs used in the
tests.  Directory "KitScripts/" contains kit scripts used in the
tests.  For instance, file "KitScripts/no_prof.script" contains
the ``kit script declaration'' 

   val region_profiling : bool = false

You can customise the test environment by editing the ML Kit
source file "src/Common/TestInfo.sml".

The directories of the form "Output_X_on_Y" contain output files
from the programs in TestEnv/Sources executed on the three
versions of the ML Kit. If you use TestInfo as it is, the
acceptance test will compare output from the programs executed
on your machine against output from the programs in these
directories.



File types
----------

.sml		sml source files.
.c		C code generated by the ANSI C version of the kit
.s		HP PA-RISC code generated by the HP PA-RISC version of the kit
.o		.c or .s files compiled using cc or gcc
.script		a ``kit script'' file sets references used globally in the kit
.log		"file.log" is a log from the compilation of "file.sml".
.vcg		a region flow graph in a text representation
		you need a particular program to view it.  See the file "readme".
.rp		output from program compiled with region profiling turned on. 
		run it through "rp2ps" to get a postscript file.

.c, .s, .vcg, and .log files are put in the target directory
(which as a default is "bin/ML_to_X_on_Y/").
