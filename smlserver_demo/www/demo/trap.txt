Testing SMLserver traps
-----------------------

Accessing this file will start the execution of the sys/trap.sml
script. The trap.sml script will print a message in the server.log
file and then return the trap.txt file to your browser. You better
check the server.log file to see that the script trap.sml is actually
executed.

This trapping mechanism is setup in the sys/init.sml file.
