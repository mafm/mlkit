<h2>Testing Charset</h2>

SMLserver does not require that you use one particular character set,
but it can only handle character sets with characters ranging from 0
to 255 (i.e., SMLserver does not support Unicode).<p>

You can use the <a href="cs_form.sml">charset</a> example to verify,
that the characters created by the script and entered in forms are
handled as expected. Especially you should check that the special
European characters such as æ,ø,å,ü,ó work as expected. You should
check that

<ul>

<li>the characters are stored correct in the database. What you store
and retrieve from the database should be the same.

<li>the characters are handled correct by the string manipulation
functions, especially regular expressions.

<li>the characters entered in forms are handled as expected.

</ul>

The HTTP standard says that the client must assume a character set of
ISO-8859-1 if no other character set is specified. In ISO-8859-1, the
character "ü" is encoded as one byte (xFC). However in Unicode, the
same character is encoded as two bytes (Ã and "1/4" as a fraction).<p>

It is very important, that the programming language (i.e., ML), the
web server (i.e., AOLserver) and the database (i.e., Oracle8i or
PostgreSQL) all work with the same character set.<p>

Because the current ML implementation in SMLserver does not support
Unicode we suggest that you use ISO-8859-1.<p>

<h3>Load Datamodel</h3>

The example uses one database table to store example strings.

<blockquote>
<pre>
drop sequence cs_seq;
create sequence cs_seq start with 2;

drop table cs;
create table cs (
  id integer primary key,
  text varchar(200) not null
);

insert into cs (id, text) values (1, 'æøåÅØÆüÃê');
commit;
</pre>
</blockquote>

We insert one row with some special characters in order to verify how
they are stored in the database.

<h4>Oracle</h4>

To load the datamodel login as type

<blockquote>
<pre>
sqlplus servicename/password < cs.sql
</pre>
</blockquote>

at the command prompt, where servicename is the Oralce login (e.g.,
scott) and password is the required Oracle password (e.g., tiger).

<h4>PostgreSQL</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre>
[TODO]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Check Character Support</h3>

Try open <a href="cs_form.sml">the entry form</a> where you can (1)
see what is in the database (2) update values in the database and (3)
add new rows to the database.<p>

You can also insert an randomly generated constant string with the
script <a href="cs_const.sml">cs_const.sml</a>.<p>
