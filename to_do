mael 2004-12-14: The definition of a "basis closure" is too strong. At
the moment too much is included in the closure, which means that
serialized bases take up a large amount of space on disk.


mael 2004-12-13: Status on MLB files.

It is now possible to compile the ML Kit itself using
MLB-files. Unfortunately, a segmentation fault occurs when compiling
General.sml - compilation of Initial.sml goes well. Some things to do:

  * Check for cycles in MLB-graph.

  ** fix bug (see above)

  * rewrite tests to use mlb-files instead of pm-files

  * modify test-utility to call mlbmake instead of mlkit when
    the argument is an mlb-file. Alternatively, exec mlbmake from
    within mlkit when the argument is an mlb-file.

  * Extend mlbmake to take a single sml-file "file.sml" as
    argument. Its semantics should then be similar to
      local $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb in file.sml end 

mael 2004-10-30 Plan for mlb-files implementation in the ML Kit.

Status: It is now possible to compile simple mlb-files and have
export-basis information stored on disk for each compilation unit. A
"dependency analysis", which is run before compilation units are
compiled, determines which exported export-bases a compilation unit
depends on.

Things to do:

 1) Move the MLB implementation outside of the ML Kit, so that it can
    be used also by the Moscow ML compiler. Figure out what
    command-line features should be supported by the ML Kit executable
    (or Moscow ML):

        mlkit -c -o myfile -load u1.eb ... uN.eb file.sml   // generates myfile.{eb,o,li}
        mlkit -o a.out -link u1 ... uN                   // generates a.out

 2) Optimize loading of export bases so that only infix and elaboration
    bases are loaded for all {u1.eb ... uN.eb} in
         
        mlkit -o myfile -load u1.eb ... uN.eb file.sml

    After the infix and elaboration bases are loaded, the program unit
    can be parsed and elaborated into a typed abstract syntax
    tree. Once the program unit has been elaborated, free identifiers
    of the program unit can be found [Els98, Chapter 4]. From this
    information, the subset U of {u1,...,uN} necessary for compilation
    can be found.

Possible things to do
---------------------

mael 2003-03-05: better pretty-printing of type variables. In
particular, types with more than 20 (or so) type variables in them are
not nicely pretty-printed in error messages and signatures (e.g., '}
should instead be 'aa). Also, it would be great if we could reuse the
name of the type variable as it occurs in the source program (e.g.,
write 'kind instead of 'aa).

mael 2003-02-04: nicer pretty-printing of signatures (mlkit
-sig). Particularly, parameterized type constructors have an extra
space.

Turn
    let f = \x.C[\y.e1] in e2

mael 2001-11-13: turn curried functions into functions that take
  multiple arguments; build the closure at the call-site for those
  functions that are not fully applied:

    let f = \x1...\xn.e in (...(f e1)...en)  ==>
    let f = \<x1...xn>.e in f <e1,...,en>
      

mael 2001-11-12: better cross-module in-lining; support in-lining of
  non-closed functions.

mael 2001-11-12: don't built closures for top-level functions; all
  free variables of such functions are either (1) top-level functions,
  which by induction have no environment, or (2) top-level variables,
  which are statically allocated.

mael 2001-11-12: unboxed implementation of datatypes that
  have any number of nullary constructors but at-most three unary
  construtors that all take boxed arguments. With gc, only two unary
  constructors are allowed for the datatype to be implemented
  unboxed. Examples of datatypes that may be implemented unboxed
  include (1) The list datatype, (2) enumerations, (3) the Binary
  tree datatypes in kit/basis/Binarymap.sml,
  kit/basis/Binaryset.sml, kit/basis/Intmap.sml,
  kit/basis/Intset.sml, kit/basis/Polyhash.sml,
  kit/basis/Splaymap.sml, and kit/basis/Splayset.sml, (4)
  Patricia trees (kit/src/Common/IntFinMapPT.sml), and (5) Union Find
  data structure (kit/src/Compiler/Kam/UnionFindPoly.sml.)

Large elaboration bases are annotated on the ast (functor bindings)
during elaboration. Such annotated bases cause opacity elimination to
be slow when compiling large programs; opacity elimination applies
realisations to ast annotated objects. To improve speed of
compilation, we should restrict the annotated bases to those
identifiers that occur free in the functor binding. Is it possible to
do this restriction during the pass for finding free identifiers
(FreeIds)?
 
Implement some kind of project reuse; it currently takes too long for
the manager to find out that the code for the basis library can be
reused. The problem is that the result basis for the basis library
project is reconstructed, from the result bases for the individual
sources of the library, every time the project is reused.

Variables that occur free in a program unit are associated with
labelled slots in the data segment of the final executable; thus,
these variables need not be stored in closures. It suffices to fetch
them from the data segment.

Currently, we do not treat multiple declarations of the same functor
identifier in the same project. We can allow this; but we cannot allow
a functor identifier to be declared more than once in a source file.

Allow in-lining of functors and pre-processing through
ML-Yacc and ML-Lex. Syntax:

     bdy ::= inline funidseq                     functor inlining
          |  local bdy in bdy end                local
	  |  bdy bdy |  _                        sequential
          |  file.sml | file.sig                 source file
          |  file.o                              precompiled object
          |  file.grm                            yacc source file
          |  file.lex                            lex source file

Declare polymorphic eq. in the initial basis, and make it impossible
to redeclare equality; if equality is in the initial basis then
in-lining happens automatically.

How are we going to model the differences between the specification of
the Math structure and the semantics of /usr/include/math.h? For now,
I think that we should just do whatever math.h does; MosML does not
implement NaN, posInf, and negInf; instead, MosML raises Overflow when
the specification suggests to return NaN, posInf, or negInf.

Implementation of Real.round on systems that do not have rint() (i.e.,
systems based on gcc's library). Real.round is broken in MosML, so we
cannot copy the code.

Why are regions that are passed to primitive functions in the runtime
system not tested for resetting automatically (in CompLamb);
currently, the user must do the resetting in the C function. Is there
a reason? What about Mogensens idea about resetting?
