The ML Kit with Regions, Version 4.0                    March 1, 2001

0. Introduction
---------------

This file describes how to install The ML Kit with Regions (from here
on just the Kit). If you intend to install the Kit on a RedHat Linux
Box, consider using one of the RPM's available from the Kit web site. 

Since you are reading this text, you have already succeeded in
unpacking the kit directory, "kit". This directory contains the
sources of the kit (src), the documentation (doc), the standard basis
library (basislib), and accompanying examples (kitdemo). As you
install and use the kit, more sub-directories and files will be
created in the directory "kit". If you want to rename the directory
from "kit" to something else or move it somewhere else, now is the
time to do so.

1. Installation
---------------

To install the ML Kit, you need Standard ML of New Jersey version
110.0.6 (later versions won't work). The ML Kit Web site at the top of
this file has links to SML/NJ.  The executable Kit will take up around
8Mb of disc space. Building it typically takes half an hour or so and
is best done on a machine with at least 64Mb of RAM. You also need to
have the UNIX utilities gmake and gcc installed on your system.




Assuming that you have "sml-cm" (SML/NJ with the compilation manager
loaded) available on your system and that you are in the "kit"
directory, type

  cd src/
  sml-cm

Now, write
 
  use "build.sml";

from within the SML/NJ system. You will now be asked whether you want
the ML Kit to generate native machine code (currently available on
only the HPUX-HPPA and Linux-X86 systems) or if you want the Kit to
generate C code to be compiled by gcc. The C backend has been tested
on the HPUX-HPPA system and on the Linux-X86 system.

If you want to build both the C version and the native code version,
you need to do so in distinct copies of the distribution.

The build script compiles the runtime system, a profiling tool
called rp2ps, a tool for testing the Kit called kittester, the ML Kit
with Regions compiler, and the Standard ML Basis Library. When the ML
Kit is installed, an executable version of the Kit is available as
"kit" in the "kit/bin" directory.


2. Check whether the Kit is properly configured
-----------------------------------------------

You can check whether the Kit is configured properly by compiling a
small example. Start the executable kit from within the "kit/kitdemo"
directory:

   cd ../kitdemo
   ../bin/kit

When the menu appears, type 7 followed by carriage return; then type
"helloworld.sml" (including the quotes and carriage return). When the Kit
has compiled the file "helloworld.sml", exit by typing

   quit

This command sends you back to the UNIX shell, where you can run the 
executable "run", which the Kit has placed in the "kitdemo" 
directory.

As explained in "Programming with Regions in the ML Kit"
(doc/manual/manual.ps.gz), users can have their own kit
script with personal preferences (flags to control optimizations,
pretty-printing of intermediate forms, etc.) The Kit does not force
you to use script files; it works fine with the default
settings. A sample kit script file "kit.script" is located in the
"kitdemo" directory.


3. On other platforms
---------------------

On other platforms, you will probably have to modify the runtime
system slightly.  Look in the make file src/Runtime/Makefile (it uses
gmake facilities). The runtime system uses the system calls signal and
setitimer in the files "Profiling.c", "Runtime.c", and "Exception.h".
The include files to use may depend on the architecture.

The Kit calls the gcc compiler to assemble (or compile) and link the
HP PA-RISC/X86 (or C) code files it generates. After a few
modifications to the source code, you may well be able to run the Kit
on other systems that has gcc and gmake installed.


4. VCG
------

The VCG tool, which is used to show region flow graphs, can be found at

5. Comments and bug reports
---------------------------

Please see the www site:

6. Known bugs/limitations
-------------------------

Arithmetic and Trigonomitric functions in Math module:
  The implementation uses the C functions specified in math.h.
  Unfortunately, these C functions are platform dependent and 
  do not always return NaN precisely when the Basis
  Library stipulates that they should.

KAM-backend (Kit Abstract Machine):
  Arithmetic operations do not raise Overflow. 

Polymorphic equality:

  Polymorphic equality is implemented only for ``regular'' data
  types. A datatype binding
 
     tyvarseq_1 tycon_1 = conbind_1 AND ... AND tvseq_n tycon_n = conbind_n

  is {\em regular\/} iff all occurrences of tycon_i, i \in {1,...,n}
  in {conbind_1, ..., conbind_n} are in the context 

     tyvarseq_i tycon_i
