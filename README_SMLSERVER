INTRODUCTION
------------

SMLserver is an SML module for AOLserver, an Open Source Web server
provided by America Online. SMLserver supports Web server
interpretation of bytecode files compiled with the MLKit. Both ML
Server Pages [1] (i.e., msp-files) and plain sml-files, using an SML
interface to the AOLserver API, are supported.

SMLserver uses a load-once-execute-many scheme for executing sml-files
and msp-files. Together with database pooling, the scheme makes it
possible to create database backed Web sites in SML that are capable
of answering a high number of requests compared to systems using a
traditional CGI based approach. The database API supports many
different RDBMS's, including Oracle and PostgreSQL.

A project file (pm-file) maintained by the Web programmer is used to
keep track of library modules, msp-files, and sml-files that are part
of the Web project. When a page is requested, SMLserver first checks
if the library modules are loaded.  If the library modules are not
loaded, SMLserver loads the library modules. Then the page requested
is loaded and executed, leaving the library modules loaded for reuse
by other requests. Only when the project is recompiled or AOLserver is
restarted, the library modules are reloaded.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

To use SMLserver you need the following:

  * Linux Box

  * AOLserver/3.2 or later. AOLserver is Open Source. You can obtain a
    version of AOLserver from http://www.aolserver.com or from
    ArsDigita (http://www.arsdigita.com/acs-repository/), where you
    can find versions of AOLserver patched with internationalization
    features, etc.

  * SMLserver. Binary RPMs, source RPMs, and tgz-packages are
    available from the SMLserver home page; see the top of this 
    file. 

  * An RDBMS. To get access to a database from within your sml/msp
    scripts, you need to have an RDBMS system installed that is
    supported by AOLserver - see below. One such RDBMS is PostgreSQL,
    which you can fetch from www.postgresql.org (if you're running
    Redhat Linux, you can even find some rpm's there). Detailed
    information about setting up a database with PostgreSQL for the
    purpose of using it with SMLserver is given below.


BUILDING SMLSERVER FROM THE TGZ-PACKAGE
---------------------------------------

The remainder of this file applies only if you are not installing
SMLserver using RPMs. To install SMLserver using RPMs, consult the
SMLserver home page; see the top of this file.

We shall assume that AOLserver is already installed. To build the
SMLserver module nssml.so, which contains the bytecode interpreter for
interpreting compiled sml-files and msp-scripts, download the MLKit
source distribution from the MLKit Web site.

After untaring the source distribution, make sure that the file
mlkit/kit/src/SMLserver/Makefile contains the correct information
about where AOLserver is installed. 

Now, go to the mlkit/kit directory and type

  # make smlserver

which builds 

  * the nssml.so module to load into AOLserver; its in the
    src/SMLserver/ directory

  * a compiler for compiling sml-files and msp-scripts into
    bytecode; its available as bin/smlserverc

INSTALLING SMLserver: To install SMLserver in /usr/share/smlserver
type 

  $ make install_smlserver:

as user root. The installation requires, that the smlserver
rpm-package is not installed. To remove the package, if it is already
installed, type 
 
  $ rpm -e smlserver

again as user root. 

CONFIGURING AOLSERVER
---------------------

To configure AOLserver to load the SMLserver module
kit/src/SMLserver/nssml.so at startup time, first copy the nssml.so
file to the place where AOLserver looks for modules. You must now edit
your nsd.tcl-file -- the file given to the AOLserver executable `nsd'
at startup. First, add the entry

   ns_param nssml nssml.so

to the section

   ns_section "ns/server/${server}/modules"

Then add the section

   ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/nssml"
   ns_param prjid sources

A sample nsd.tcl init file is available as
smlserver_demo/nsd.scs.tcl.  After restarting AOLserver, you should
inspect the AOLserver server.log file and see that AOLserver is
running and that the nssml.so module is loaded. You should now be able
to try the example project demo.pm.


COMPILING THE EXAMPLE PROJECT demo.pm
-----------------------------------------------------

Start by copying the smlserver_demo/ directory to your personal
server root directory. Also copy the content files of the
smlserver_demo/www directory to your personal www directory. Your
directory structure should now look as follows:

   /web/user/
      www/
        demo.pm
        index.sml ...
      lib/
        Ns.sml ...
      log/
        server.log ...
      demo_lib/
        ...
      ...

To make the msp-pages and sml-pages that appear in the demo.pm file
in the www directory available to browsers, make demo.pm the *current
Web project* by executing:
  
  # cd www
  # ln -s demo.pm sources.pm

Thereafter, compile the current SMLserver project by running:

  # smlserverc sources.pm

Assuming that you have AOLserver running with the SMLserver module
loaded, you should now be able to fetch the page demo/index.sml from
your browser using the url

  http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/index.sml

which lists a series of examples.

POSTGRESQL DETAILS
------------------

Postinstallation details for setting up Postgresql on a RedHat 7.x
system with rpm's installed:

  1. Start up the postmaster deamon process. Execute (as root) the
     following command:

         $ /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql start

  2. Create a database user `dbuser' (or whatever login name you
     have):

         # su - postgres
         $ createuser -P dbuser

     Answer yes to both questions asked by createuser. 

  3. As user `dbuser', create a database `yourdb' as follows:

         # createdb yourdb
         ...

     You can now use the command `psql' to control your database and
     submit sql-queries and commands to your database.

  4. Insert the following sections in your nsd.tcl-file - the file
     given to the Web server executable `nsd' at startup:

         ns_section "ns/db/drivers" 
         ns_param nspostgres ${bindir}/nspostgres.so

         ns_section "ns/db/pools" 
         ns_param main "Main Pool" 

	 ns_section "ns/db/pool/main" 
	 ns_param Driver nspostgres 
	 ns_param Connections 5                 ;# 5 is a good number. Increase according to your needs
	 ns_param DataSource localhost::yourdb  ;# Replace 'yourdb' with the name of your database in PG
	 ns_param User dbuser                   ;# User and password AOLserver will use to connect
	 ns_param Password yourpassword 
	 ns_param Verbose Off                   ;# Set it to On to see all queries. Good for debugging SQL.
	 ns_param LogSQLErrors On 
	 ns_param ExtendedTableInfo On 

	 ns_section "ns/server/${user}/db" 
	 ns_param Pools "*" 
	 ns_param DefaultPool "main"

     Make sure that the driver nspostgres.so is located in AOLserver's
     bin-directory.

  5. Restart AOLserver.

  6. Install data models for demonstration programs

        # cd demo_lib/pgsql
        # psql
           ...
        user=# \i all.sql
           ...
        user=# \q

  7. Go visit the database examples from

        http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo/index.sml


TO DO
-----

  * Functor applications and functor declarations are not allowed in
    leaf-files in projects. That is, for a project file (.pm-file):
  
	local
	 a.sml b.sml
	in
	 [c.sml d.sml]
	end

    the files a.sml and b.sml may contain functor applications and
    functor declarations whereas the files c.sml and d.sml may not.
