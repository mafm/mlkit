 * mael 2001-09-30: Added regular expression support (structure RegExp) 
   to the basis library. The implementation is based on an 
   implementation by Ken Friis Larsen. See the file 
   kit/basislib/REG_EXP.sml for details.

 * mael 2001-09-30: Program manager changes: (1) It is now 
   possible for two files in different subdirectories to have the same
   name and be listed in the same pm-file. (2) Target-files generated
   when compiling a pm-file (i.e., uo-files for the bytecode backend
   and o-files for the native x86 backend) are now stored in a PM
   directory located in the same directory as the compiled pm-file is
   located; this change allows for a pm-file to refer to source files
   located in directories for which the user does not have 
   write-permission.

   is available in the top-level environment. Moreover, the character
   ` cease to be allowed in symbolic identifiers. Values of the 'a

 * many bug fixes

 * replaced HP backend with x86 native backend

 * bytecode backend added as an alternative to the x86 native backend;
   primarily, the bytecode backend is added for portability and for
   use with the SMLserver project, which adds Standard ML language
   support to AOLserver -- a webserver from America Online
 
 * added support for reference tracing garbage collection

 * Word31, Word32, Word8, Int31 and Int32 structures added
